# NOTE:
- on the latest patch, riot fixed something/did something where the game doesn’t stretch to fit the monitors resolutions... if you wanted 4:3 you’ll be left with black bars....

## Description

This project provides a true stretched resolution experience for the game, enhancing visual immersion and giving players a competitive edge. Unlike standard resolution or "fake stretch" settings, this tool adjusts the game’s field of view and aspect ratio, delivering a fully authentic stretched appearance.
